          <h3>A unique merchant bank</h3>
          <p>
            Ash Creek is a boutique Merchant Bank dedicated to assisting businesses who have a clear vision of 
            their goals and objectives.  <br>
            Over 20+ years and 30+ investments, Ash Creek members have assisted small and mid-market companies 
            to accelerate revenue growth and, only then, provide investors with a meaningful return.

      <h3>Business development </h3>
      <p>
        Especially for startups, most entrepreneurs have a keen eye for market needs,
         product viability and have built a workable technology, product, or solution. 
         But not all of them have a competitive advantage in distribution. <br>
        And that makes all the difference. <br>
        Where needed, Ash Creek members roll up their sleeves to make warm introductions and/or to follow 
        through to enterprise sales.

      <h3> Investments </h3>
      <p>
        Most of our investments have been made in conjunction with family offices and other investment groups. 
         It is not unusual for us to create a Special Purpose Entity (SPE), a limited liability company,
          for investing in situations where the investment may be larger.  There is no minimum investment.<br>
          Before we invest, we conduct extensive due diligence to make sure the economic, marketing and financial
           models all work together.<br>
           Finally, one of the businesses funded back in 2019 has become a Unicorn and will exit the year 
           with a $1 billion valuation. <br>
