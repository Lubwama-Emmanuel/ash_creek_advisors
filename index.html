      <h3>Business development </h3>
      <p>
        Especially for startups, most entrepreneurs have a keen eye for market needs,
         product viability and have built a workable technology, product, or solution. 
         But not all of them have a competitive advantage in distribution. <br>
        And that makes all the difference. <br>
        Where needed, Ash Creek members roll up their sleeves to make warm introductions and/or to follow 
        through to enterprise sales.
